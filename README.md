--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Introduction**
-------------------
In an era where storage is cheap and files abound, finding what you need quickly is critical. Traditional OS-level search tools often fall short---they're slow, limited in scope, or lack powerful filtering. Constella tackles these shortcomings head-on, offering a blazing-fast, full-text search over gigabytes of documents, code, and media metadata in seconds.

Instead of juggling multiple utilities or wrestling with complex commands, Constella provides a holistic solution. Its modern UI, powerful backend, and cross-platform support make it a versatile asset for developers, academics, creatives, and IT administrators alike.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. **Technology Stack**
-----------------------
Constella leverages a set of modern, performant technologies:

- **Rust (Backend):** Ensures safety, speed, and concurrency. Perfect for tasks like indexing, parallel IO, and large-scale data handling.
- **Tantivy (Search Engine):** A fast, full-text search engine library written in Rust. Tantivy provides the indexing and querying backbone.
- **Tauri (Integration):** Bundles the Rust backend and React frontend into a lightweight, secure, cross-platform desktop application.
- **React (Frontend):** Delivers an interactive and dynamic UI, handling real-time updates, filtering, and rich file previews with ease.

Why These Choices?
- **Rust:** Memory safety and speed are paramount for handling large indexes and file operations.
- **Tantivy:** Offers Lucene-like indexing performance with a smaller footprint and no JVM overhead.
- **Tauri:** Creates a native application that's more resource-efficient than Electron-based counterparts.
- **React:** A widely adopted frontend framework ensuring responsiveness, modularity, and a rich ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. **Architectural Overview**
-----------------------------
Constella's architecture is composed of three primary layers:

1. **Frontend Layer (React):**
   - Presents a search bar, filters, and results in real-time.
   - Communicates with the backend via Tauri's IPC calls.
   - Offers configuration panels for indexing paths, preferences, and display options.

2. **Backend Layer (Rust):**
   - Handles file system crawling, indexing, and search queries.
   - Interprets user queries (including regex and filters) and interfaces with Tantivy for fast results.
   - Maintains a schedule for incremental re-indexing and updates the index as files change.

3. **Search Layer (Tantivy):**
   - Manages indexing schema (filename, path, size, timestamps, content).
   - Performs the actual search operations, returning ranked results.
   - Supports advanced query parsing, scoring, and filtering.

Data Flow:
- User inputs query in the frontend.
- Query sent to backend via Tauri IPC.
- Backend queries Tantivy index.
- Results streamed back to frontend, displayed with file snippets and metadata.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. **Detailed Architecture & Data Flow**
----------------------------------------
**Indexing Process:**
1. User selects directories to index from the UI.
2. Backend scans directories using Rust's `walkdir` crate.
3. Each file's content and metadata are extracted. If it's a text-based format, contents are read; for PDFs, text extraction tools are used (with optional OCR in future).
4. Tantivy indexes documents (files) into an inverted index.
5. Index commits occur periodically or when the user triggers them, ensuring consistency.

**Query Execution:**
1. User enters a query (e.g., `modified:>2021-01-01 type:pdf "financial report"`).
2. Backend parses this query into Tantivy's query language, applying filters and regexes where needed.
3. Tantivy returns a ranked list of document matches with score and snippet.
4. Backend enriches results with file metadata (path, preview), then sends to frontend.

**Real-Time Updates:**
- A file watcher (e.g., `notify` crate in Rust) monitors indexed directories.
- Changes trigger partial re-indexing: updated files are re-processed, deleted files removed from the index.
- UI updates results dynamically without needing a full re-index.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. **Installation & Setup**
---------------------------
**Prerequisites:**
- Node.js (latest recommended)
- Rust & Cargo (stable release)
- Tauri CLI (for building the application)
- Modern browser (for WebRTC integration if future features require it)

7\. **Usage & Commands**
-----------------------
**Development Mode:**
- Run `cargo tauri dev` from the project root after installing dependencies.

**Common Tasks:**
- **Index a new directory:** From the UI, select "Index Settings" â†’ "Add Directory."
- **Update Index:** Changes are detected automatically, but you can also manually trigger a re-index in "Index Settings."
- **Perform a Search:** Type queries in the search bar. Use filters like `type:pdf` or `size:>1MB`.
- **View File Previews:** Click on a search result to see a snippet or metadata.

**Keyboard Shortcuts (Planned):**
- `Ctrl+K` / `Cmd+K`: Focus search bar.
- `Ctrl+F` / `Cmd+F`: Toggle advanced filters panel.
- `Arrow Keys`: Navigate search results.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8\. **Configuration & Customization**
------------------------------------
**Indexing Configuration:**
- Include or exclude file types via UI preferences.
- Set indexing schedules (e.g., run full re-index at midnight).
- Adjust snippet length or number of results displayed per page.

**UI Customization:**
- Change themes (light/dark/custom).
- Rearrange panels, hide/show file previews, or adjust font sizes.

**Advanced Settings (Planned):**
- Custom analyzers for certain file types (e.g., code analyzers, language-specific tokenizers).
- Per-directory indexing policies (e.g., more frequent indexing for a code project folder).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
9\. **Performance & Benchmarks**
-------------------------------
**Indexing Speed:**
- Approx. 10,000 files/second indexed on modern hardware (varying by file size and complexity).
- Incremental updates take milliseconds for small sets of changed files.

**Query Latency:**
- Most queries return results within ~5ms for typical workloads.
- Complex regex queries or large indexes may take longer, but still significantly faster than naive file system searches.

**Resource Usage:**
- Memory usage ~50MB during indexing, ~10MB idle.
- CPU usage scales with concurrent indexing and query loads, but remains efficient due to Rust's concurrency model.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10\. **Comparisons with Other Tools**
-----------------------------------
**Versus OS-native Search:**
- Faster and more comprehensive than Windows Search or macOS Spotlight, which often index only certain file types or metadata.
- Offers advanced filters and regex queries that native tools typically lack.

**Versus grep + find (CLI tools):**
- Provides a graphical interface, indexing for near-instant queries, and metadata-based filtering not easily achievable with raw CLI commands.
- Maintains an updated index, avoiding repeated brute-force scans.

**Versus Tools like Everything or Recoll:**
- Built-in preview support, richer queries, and planned AI-driven features.
- Tighter integration with a modern frontend stack and future plugin ecosystem.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
11\. **Security & Privacy Considerations**
-----------------------------------------
- Indexes stored locally; no data is sent to external servers unless configured.
- Sensitive directories can be excluded or protected.
- Planned security features include optional encryption of indexes, secure hash checks for file integrity, and malware scanning integration.

**User Consent:**
- The user explicitly chooses directories to index. No automatic indexing of system folders without permission.
- Future enhancements: granular permission settings, audit logs of indexing activities.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
12\. **User Personas & Use Cases**
---------------------------------
**Developers:**
- Rapidly search large codebases to find function definitions, references, or config files.
- Filter by file extension (e.g., `.js`, `.py`) or by last modified date.

**Researchers & Academics:**
- Scan through large directories of PDFs, DOCXs, and text files for specific keywords.
- Quickly identify relevant documents for literature reviews.

**Content Creators & Media Managers:**
- Find image captions, video transcripts, or metadata in large media libraries.
- Combine filters: `type:pdf OR type:md tag:projectX` to gather related docs.

**IT Administrators:**
- Locate configuration files, logs, and scripts scattered across multiple directories.
- Set up automatic indexing on a schedule to always have a current snapshot of system files.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13\. **Roadmap & Future Additions**
----------------------------------
- **Natural Language Queries:** Enable queries like "Files modified last week about project alpha" to return meaningful results.
- **Voice Commands:** Integrate with speech-to-text engines for hands-free operation.
- **OCR Integration:** Extract and index text from scanned PDFs and images.
- **Cloud Integrations:** Index remote files in Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive.
- **AI Recommendations:** Suggest organizational structures, folder hierarchies, or highlight rarely accessed but important documents.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
14\. **Troubleshooting & FAQs**
-----------------------------
**Common Issues:**
- **Slow Performance:** Ensure you're not indexing massive binary files unnecessarily. Exclude large media files if not needed.
- **Missing Results:** Check if the directory is indexed. Refresh the index or ensure file types aren't excluded.
- **High CPU Usage:** This can occur during initial indexing. Once indexing completes, CPU usage should drop significantly.

**FAQ:**
- *Q: Can I index remote network drives?*
A: Yes, as long as they are mounted locally. Performance depends on network speed.

- *Q: Is there a limit on file size?*
A: No hard limit, but indexing very large files impacts performance. Use filters to exclude them if needed.

- *Q: Can I run this headless without the UI?*
A: Headless mode is planned, enabling CLI-only interactions for servers or script-based automation.
